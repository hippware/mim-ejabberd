# Module description

This module enables forwarding certain events (messages, presence, etc.) to an
external service via HTTP, for example push (by mobile, email or SMS), big data,
or analytics services.

## How it works

The module registers a `user_send_packet` hook every time a user sends anything
the hook is triggered, the module does the following:

* checks whether http_notification is enabled (the `host` param is set)
* runs a callback module's `should_make_req/3` function to see if a notification should be sent
* asks poolboy for a worker process (this is to limit a number of concurrent requests)
* sends a POST request composed of `{Host::binary(), Sender::binary(), Receiver::binary(), Message::binary()}` to the http notification server

## Callback module

To find out what should be sent to the HTTP server, MongooseIM calls `Mod:should_make_req(Packet::xmlel(), From::jid(), To::jid())`.
Default is to use function in mod_http_notification itself, which ships all non-empty chat messages
and nothing else. The module can be substituted here, the method should return `true | false`.

# Options

* `host`: this is where the HTTP notification server should listen.
* `prefix_path`: path part of URL to which a request should be sent.
* `callback_module`: name of a module which should be used to check whether a
notification should be sent.
* `pool_size`: size of a worker pool, imposes a limit of the number of concurrent requests
to HTTP server; default is 100.
* `pool_timeout`: how long to wait for an available worker; default is 200 ms (has to be
very short so that we don't run into problems if there is a message flood).
* `worker_timeout`: how much time do we give HTTP server to process requests before we
bail out; default is 5000 ms.


# Example configuration

`  {mod_http_notification, [{pool_size, 5}, {host, "http://localhost:8000"}]}`
